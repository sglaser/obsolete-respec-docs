    <h2>HTML Basics</h2>

    <p>PCISIG Specifications are written in HTML5. Only a small portion of HTML5 is required.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>HTML5 syntax</h2>

        <p>HTML5 documents are written in text. While modern HTML supports UTF-8, PCISIG usage uses just the ACSII
            characters. Other characters are represented using <a>Entities</a>.
        </p>
        <p>HTML documents consist of a collection of <code>elements</code>. Most elements consist of 3 parts:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><dfn>Element Start</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Describes the element type and containing optional attributes. Consists of the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The character <code>&lt;</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Optional whitespace</li>
                    <li>The element name: one or more characters, typically lower case</li>
                    <li>
                        Zero of more attributes seperated by whitespace, each consisting of:
                        <ol>
                            <li>An attribute name: sequence of letters, digits, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>,
                                <code>_</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>Optional whitespace</li>
                            <li>Optional <code>=</code> character
                            </li>
                            <li>Optional whitespace</li>
                            <li>Optional attribute value: sequence of characters enclosed in either single
                                (<code>'</code>) or double (<code>"</code>) quotes
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Optional whitespace</li>
                    <li>The character <code>&gt;</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn>Element Content</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A sequence of elements and/or text. Element Content is optional. Some elements have no content (e.g.
                    <code>&lt;img&gt;)</code>. Text characters <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> are written as
                    <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;amp;</code> so they don't get interpreted as elements or
                    entities (see below).
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn>Element End</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Indicates the end of an element. Not present for some element types (e.g. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>). Consists of the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The character <code>&lt;</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>The character <code>/</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Optional whitespace</li>
                    <li>The element name (which must match name in the Element Start)</li>
                    <li>Optional whitespace</li>
                    <li>The character <code>&gt;</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Here are a few example elements:</p>
            <pre class="example" title="Example Elements">&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="images/picture.png"&gt;

&lt;figure id="fig-picture42"&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/picture42.png"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Caption for the Figure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;section id="sect-section123"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Caption of the section&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This is a paragraph
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is the first item of an ordered list&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is the second item of an ordered list&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Key HTML Elements</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Paragraph. <a>Element Content</a> is rendered as a distinct paragraph.</dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Section in a document. Usually followed by a header element (e.g. <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>).</dd>
            <dt><code>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt; &lt;h5&gt; &lt;h6&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Header element. In our use, these always immediately follow a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element. The
                actual header level doesn't matter. Informal convention is to use <code>&lt;h2&gt;.</code>
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;br&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Hard Break. Indicates that the content that follows this element should start a new line in the output.
                Use sparingly. Preferred usage is <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. This element has no <a>Element Content</a> and
                does not have an <a>Element End</a>.
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Ordered list. Represents a numbered list. Automatically changes numbering style based on nesting level.
                Items in the list use <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Unordered list. Represents a bulleted list. Automatically changes the bullet style based on nesting
                level. Items in the list use <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;li&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>List Item. Parent is always <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>

                <p>When a list item contains nested lists, the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, or
                    <code>
                        &lt;dl&gt;</code> element is completely contained inside the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element.
                </p>
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Definition List. Represents a list of terms and definitions. Used whenever there a key / value
                correspondence, not just for glossary-like situations. Items in the list are a sequence of <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>
                and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;dt&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Definition Term. Represents the term being defined in a definition list. Usually followed by <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>.
                Can be repeated for situations where there are multiple terms with the same definition.
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;dd&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Definition Data. Represents the definition of the immediately preceding <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>
                element(s). Can be repeated when there are multiple alternative definitions.
                <p>When Definition Data contains nested lists, the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, or
                    <code>
                        &lt;dl&gt;</code> element is completely contained inside the <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> element.
                </p>
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Definition of a term. Marks the location in the document that contains the authoritative definition of a
                term. PCISIG usage adds a <code>class</code> attribute that described the type of the term. The element
                content is the term being defined. This content will be copied directly to all references to ensure
                consistent formatting (e.g. capitalization, superscript, subscript, &hellip; The <code>title</code>
                attribute can be used to provide the name used to reference this term. If <code>title</code> is not
                present, the reference name consists of the text content of the element, converted to lower case (with
                all element tags removed).
                <p>Supported <code>class</code> attribute values are:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><code>class="argument"</code></dt>
                    <dt><code>class="command"</code></dt>
                    <dt><code>class="dfn"</code> <i>&nbsp; &larr; the default</i></dt>
                    <dt><code>class="field"</code></dt>
                    <dt><code>class="message"</code></dt>
                    <dt><code>class="msg"</code></dt>
                    <dt><code>class="op"</code></dt>

                    <dt><code>class="term"</code></dt>
                    <dt><code>class="value"</code></dt>
                </dl>
                The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is used when referencing terms defined with <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code>.
            </dd>

            <dt><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>Anchor element. Marks a reference to a term, section, figure, table, example, equation, or web site.

                There are three usage patterns in PCISIG Specifications.
                <dl>
                    <dt>Definition reference</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            These consist of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> with no href attribute and an <a>element
                            content</a> of the reference name for the term.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <code>class</code> attribute is optional and can be used in situations where there are
                            multiple definitions for the same term with different classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <a>element content</a> is replaced with the element content from the associated <code>
                            &lt;dfn&gt;</code> element.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, the reference <a>tmax</a> which is written as either
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;tmax&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                        </blockquote>
                        or
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>&lt;a class="parameter"&gt;tmax&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                        </blockquote>
                        references the definition <dfn class="parameter">T<sub>max</sub></dfn> which is written as
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>&lt;dfn class="parameter"&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt;</code>
                        </blockquote>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Section, Figure, Table, Example, or Equation reference</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>These consist of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element an href attribute and no <a>element
                            content</a>.

                            The <code>href</code> attribute value starts with a number sign <code>#</code> followed by
                            the name of the referenced Section, Figure, Table, Example, or Equation.

                        </p>
                        <p>This name is either the <code>id</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>
                            &lt;figure&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div class="example"&gt;</code>,
                            or <code>&lt;div class="equation"&gt;</code> element.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In some cases, if there is no <code>id</code> attribute, one is constructed using the <code>title</code>
                            attribute or, for some element types, the <code>&lt;h<i>N</i>&gt;</code>, <code>
                            &lt;caption&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> elements from the element
                            content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <a>Element Content</a> is created from the referenced element.

                            Both the number of the referenced element (chapter, section, figure, table, &hellip;) and,
                            where defined, the caption of the referenced element are inserted. CSS formatting rules can
                            be used to hide whatever is not appropriate, perhaps based on output media (PDF, online,
                            etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p>For example the reference <a href="#sect-key-html-elements"></a> which is written as
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>&lt;a href="#sect-key-html-elements"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                        </blockquote>
                        references the current section of this document, which is defined as
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>&lt;section&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h2&gt;Key HTML Elements&lt;/h2&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;

                        </blockquote>
                        but could also have been defined as
                        <blockquote>
                            <code>&lt;section id="sect-key-html-elements"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h4&gt;Arbitrary

                        <p>
                            These consist of am <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with both an href attribute and element
                            content.

                    <dt><code>src="directory/filename.xxx"</code></dt>
                    <dd>Defines the filename that contains the HTML usable description of the figure. This is typically
                        an svg, png or jpeg file. The directory and/or filename are relative to the HTML file that
                        contains the reference.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>data-orig="directory/filename.yyy</code></dt>
                    <dd>Defines the filename that contains the original version of the figure. This attribute is
                        currently ignored, but in the future will be used to validate that the src file is newer than
                        this file. This file is associated with the document processing software (e.g. Visio, Adobe
                        Illustrator, SolidWorks, etc.). The directory and/or filename are relative to the HTML file that
                        contains the reference.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>width="42%"</code></dt>
                    <dd>Defines the width of the figure as a percentage of the column width. When no other related
                        parameters are specified, height and width are scaled to maintain the aspect ratio of the

        <h2><dfn>Entities</dfn></h2>

        <p>When you need to represent a special character, you use an entity. Entities consist of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The ampersand character <code>&amp;</code>
            <li>The entity name: sequence of letters, digits, and <code>-</code>
            </li>
            <li>The semicolon character <code>;</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are a huge number of entities defined. See <a href='http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref'>http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref</a>

        <h2>Register Diagrams</h2>

        <p>ReSpec has been extended to automatically draw register diagrams commonly used in PCISIG specifications. The
            author defines the register fields using a table and includes a stylized <code>
                &lt;figure&gt;</code> element that references the table and provides additional information about the
            generated figure.
        </p>

        <p>Within the table:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>class</code> attribute must contain <code>pcisig_reg</code></li>
            <li>The <code>id</code> attribute contains the cross reference name of the table. If not present, it is
                generated from the <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> text.
            </li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code> elements have no effect on the generated
                figure.
            </li>
            <li>In the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element:
                <ul>
                    <li>The first column of each table row describes the bit(s) associated with the field.
                    </li>
                    <li>The second column of each table row describes the field. The field name is extracted from the
                        <code>&lt;dfn&nbsp;class="field"&gt;</code> element. If no <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> element is
                        present, the field name is the first word of the the table cell. The table cell may contain
                        multiple paragraphs, lists, etc. Use Definition Lists, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> to describe
                        encoded field values.
                    </li>
                    <li>The third column of each table row describes the attributes of the field. This selected
                        attribute values are passed through to the generated figure to support custom css formatting.
                    </li>
                    <li>Other content has no effect on the generated figure.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Within the figure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>class</code> attribute must contain <code>register</code> and <code>pcisig_reg</code></li>
            <li>The <code>data-table</code> attribute contains the id of the associated table.</li>
            <li>The <code>data-width</code> attribute contains the width (in bits) of the register. Default is 32 bits.
            </li>
            <li>The <code>data-unused</code> attribute contains the text used for bits that are not otherwise defined.
                Default is &ldquo;RsvdP&rdquo;. If the full name won't fit, the first character of this value is used
                instead.
            </li>
            <li>The <code>data-json</code> attribute contains additional information describing the figure (see below).
                This attribute is rarely needed.
            </li>
            <li>The <code>id</code> attribute contains the cross reference name of the figure. If not present, it is
                generated from the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> text.
            </li>
            <li>The element content may contain zero or more <code>&lt;pre class="json"&gt;</code> elements. These
                contain additional information describing the figure (see below). This feature is rarely needed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following example describes a simple 16 bit register named <i>My Register</i>. The generated figure is <a
                href="#fig-myregister"></a>. The underlying table is <a href="#tbl-myregister"></a>.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Definition for a 16 bit 'My Register'">
            &lt;figure class="register pcisig_reg"

                        &lt;th&gt;Attributes&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;/thead&gt;
                &lt;tbody&gt;
                    &lt;tr&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;1:0&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;td&gt;&lt;dfn class="field"&gt;Field One&lt;/dfn&gt; defines
                            the first field of the register.&lt;/td&gt;

    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <section>
        <p>
            The primary use case for ReSpec is writing PCISIG specifications and this is what this guide covers. It can
            indeed be used for other document types (this documentation is itself written using a different ReSpec
            profile) but if that is your situation either of two cases apply: 1) you're using an existing profile that
            someone wrote, if so please consult the documentation for that profile; or 2) you're developing your own
            profile in which case you will want to read the <a href='dev.html'>Developer's Guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The User's Guide is organised in such a way that a complete newcomer may read it linearly and understand
            everything. That being said, read it in whatever order you think makes most sense to you, there are only
            limited references spanning sections.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Basic Layout</h2>

        <p>
            Here we introduces the basic template that most specifications will want to start from, explaining the core
            principles at play. We also look at basics elements of styling and parts that you can't do without.
        </p>
        <p>
            A ReSpec document is essentially a straightforward HTML document that brings in the ReSpec script, defines a
            few configuration variables, and follows a few conventions. The simplest way to see it at work is to look at
            an example — and don't worry if everything isn't immediately clear.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" data-include='examples/minimal-pcisig.html' data-include-format='text'></pre>
        <p>
            Before anything else, you may wish to see <a href='examples/minimal-pcisig.html'>this example in action</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is essentially the smallest PCISIG specification you can write using ReSpec (in practice, you could
            eliminate a few things but then you would have a truly useless document). Some of the configuration may seem
            cryptic, but it is there because all W3C documents must have some specific information available — all will
            be explained soon.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>The Very Basics</h2>

            <p>
                As you can see, the document that is rendered in your browser is quite different from the one which is
                authored here. Yet they are the same document, with a sprinkle of ReSpec on top. If <i>really</i> care
                about details and you have a tool in your browser such as Firebug, Dragonfly, or other such developer
                tools, you may wish to take a look at the real DOM that is being produced and compare it with the
                source.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some basic things can be seen above. First, as you can see from the <code>DOCTYPE</code> and the <code>section</code>
                elements, ReSpec documents are built on HTML5. This does not imply that you need to know the ins and
                outs of HTML5 — just a few simple bits will suffice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that the <code>title</code> of the document is reused as the title of the specification in the
                resulting document's <code>h1</code>. It's a small win, but that's always something less to repeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>meta</code> element is merely there to indicate the encoding in cases in which it may be
                misunderstood (which are many). It may not always be necessary, but I recommend that you leave it there.
                (You're saving your documents as UTF-8, right? Right? Right? Yes, of course you are. Right?)
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Including ReSpec</h2>

            <p>
                You can see that the example above includes a script sourced at <code>http://sglaser.github.io/respec/builds/respec-pcisig-common.js</code>.
                That is the ReSpec profile for PCISIG specifications. If you look at examples in the wild you may on
                occasion find other links — but use this one. You may also be tempted to save the script to your local
                directory and use it from there. That may on occasion be useful (e.g. if you're on a flight and your
                cache is busted) but I strongly recommend that you link to the canonical URL provided above. The code is
                regularly updated and this will allow you to benefit from bug fixes and enhancements without even having
                to think about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may be wondering what that <code>class='remove'</code> is doing in there. We'll get to that later,
                but be sure to keep it on those <code>script</code> elements.

            <h2>Specifying Configuration</h2>

            <p>
                In the example you can see a <code>script</code> element defining a <code>respecConfig</code> variable.
                Astute as you are, you've guessed that this is the ReSpec configuration. There are many things that can
                be done there, but we won't get into the details right now, but rather explore it piece by piece as
                needed. No doubt you can guess what some of those fields do.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing to remember though is this: that is how configuration is specified in ReSpec. Whenever you
                will see an indication that you can set a configuration option to a given value, it will be by modifying
                this object, simply adding, removing, or changing one of its fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note that this is just a simple JavaScript variable; there is nothing magical about the way in
                which it is declared (it just needs to be fully defined when the load event triggers). If for instance
                you are working on a family of specifications that share some information (e.g. working group, editors)
                you can specify those in a common file which you load, and then add the document-specific fields.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Sections</h2>

            <p>
                Sections in ReSpec specifications are specified using — shock! — the <code>section</code> element. These
                can be nested, and the first <code>h*</code> child element is taken to be the section's title. You do
                not need to worry about nesting depth: ReSpec will take any element in the
                <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> range and renumber it to match the section's nesting depth correctly. It
                is a common convention (though by no means a requirement) to use <code>h2</code> for all sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two first sections in this example specification are special (and required). We will get to those in
                the next chapter. For the time being, just accept them as part of the basic specification template.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last section in the specification is a regular section — it is simply there in order for there to be
                a little bit of content. There is no requirement to start a document with an introduction, though of
                course that's not necessarily a bad idea.
            </p>

            <h2>Language</h2>

            <p>
                PCISIG specifications are assumed to be in English. As a result, if you don't specify a
                <code>lang</code> attribute on your root element, ReSpec will add <code>lang='en'</code> as well as
                <code>dir='ltr'</code>. This does not prevent you from using other languages though: simply specify your
                own <code>lang</code> (in which case you may wish to also specify your own <code>dir</code> for good
                measure).
            </p>

        <h2>Essential PCISIG Boilerplate</h2>

        <p>
            PCISIG boilerplate is extremely repetitive, but beneath the tedium is a wealth of options and subtle
            variations that are precisely what makes crafting the boilerplate by hand so hard to get right. This covers
            options for specification maturity, publication dates, alternatives (editor's drafts, other versions, other
            formats...), legalese variants, the various W3C specification URLs, the people writing it, information about
            the working group, and core sections such as Abstract, Status of this Document, and Conformance.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will start by using an example of a basic specification very similar to the one used in the previous
            section.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" data-include='examples/boilerplate.html' data-include-format='text'></pre>
        <p>
            You can <a href='examples/boilerplate.html'>see the result in action</a>.
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
            There's a nifty trick that you will likely want to keep in your toolbox: many of ReSpec's configuration
            options can be specified in the query string (separated by semicolons) and they override the options
            specified in the source. We will use it a lot in this documentation so as to avoid having to generate
            examples for each small change that is possible (there are quite a few). So if I want to test the <a>subtitle</a>
            option without generating a copy of the same example with just that option changed, instead of accessing
            <code>examples/boilerplate.html</code> I can simply go to <code>examples/boilerplate.html?subtitle=This%20is%20a%20subtitle</code>.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>Title, Subtitle, Short Name</h2>

            <p>
                As noted in the previous chapter, the <code>title</code> of the document is reused as the title of the
                specification in the resulting document's <code>h1</code>. That way, they are always in sync and you
                need not worry about specifying it twice. Including a title is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optionally, you can also specify a subtitle. The <a>subtitle</a> configuration option takes a simple
                string that will be used as a subtitle for the specification, right under the title. You can <a
                    href='examples/boilerplate.html?subtitle=Breaking%20the%20web%20in%20the%20animal%20kingdom'>look at
                an example</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifications typically require having a "short name", which is the name used (amongst other places) in
                the canonical "http://w3.org/TR/short-name/" URLs. This is specified using the <a>shortName</a> option,
                as seen in the example above. <a href='examples/boilerplate.html?shortName=something-else'>Look at an
                example</a>.

            <h2>Working Group Information</h2>

            <p>
                Most (but not all) W3C documents are produced by groups of some sort: Working Groups (WG), Interest
                Groups (IG), Incubator Groups (XG, now defunct), Coordination Groups, the TAG, and Community or Business
                Groups (CG, BG). For simplicity, we will be referring to all of the above as "Working Groups", since one
                should not be required to understand the many subtleties of the W3C Process in order to write a good
                specification. Configuration options that are prefixed with <code>wg</code> work equally well for all
                group types.
            </p>
            <p>
                When these groups release a document, they must include some information that is relevant and specific
                to them — all of this information is required. Documents produced in other situations (e.g. Submissions,
                unofficial drafts, etc.) don't require these options.
            </p>
            <div data-include='src/conf/wg.html' data-oninclude='mungeConf'></div>
            <div data-include='src/conf/wgURI.html' data-oninclude='mungeConf'></div>

            <p>
                The result of changing these configuration options can be seen in the "Status of this Document" section.
                Here is <a
                    href='examples/boilerplate.html?wg=Supercool%20Incubator%20Group;wgURI=http://berjon.com/;wgPublicList=public-supercool-xg;wgPatentURI=http://berjon.com/'>an
                example with different values</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Incubator Groups require some additional information in addition to the above, but since this group type
                no longer exists they are deprecated: <a href='ref.html#xgrGroupShortName'>xgrGroupShortName</a>, <a
                    href='ref.html#xgrDocShortName'>xgrDocShortName</a>.

            <h2>Specification Status</h2>

            <p>
                At any given time a specification must be in a given status. The <a>specStatus</a> option indicates
                which status that is. Typically, a status has implications in terms of what other options may be
                required. For instance, a document that is intended to become a Recommendation eventually and that is
                not the First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of that specification will require <a>previousPublishDate</a>
                and <a>previousMaturity</a> to be specified. The following table lists the values currently understood.
                Each of them has an example link demonstrating what it produces.
            </p>
            <p>
                The values for this configuration are rich and complex, and so are detailed in the <a
                    href='ref.html#specStatus'>reference section for specStatus</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Extra links at top of the document</h2>

            <p>
                There are times when you might need extra links or other important information to appear together with
                other links at the top of the document. For example, you might want to have a link to the commit history
                for the specification.
            </p>

            <p>
                ReSpec supports adding additional links by specifying an <code>otherLinks</code> property in the
                configuration. The values for this configuration option are rich and complex, so are detailed in the <a
                    href="ref.html#otherLinks">reference section for otherLinks</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Extra Styling</h2>

            <p>
                If you wish to add your own additional styles to your document, just use the regular <code>link</code>
                and <code>style</code> elements. Be warned however that the W3C styles will <em>always</em> be added
                after yours, so if you wish to override them you will need to use more specific selectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some old documents, you will on occasion find an <a>extraCSS</a> configuration option. Do not use it,
                it is deprecated.

            <h2>Dates</h2>

            <p>
                The process of publishing specifications typically involves releasing multiple versions in a row that
                have specific dates (so that people can see the evolution, and also for IP reasons). Additionally, some
                specification statuses involve delimited review periods. These are all specified using date-related
                options.
            </p>
            <p>
                The format used for all dates is <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.

            <h2>Editors &amp; Authors</h2>

            <p>
                Every specification must have some <a>editors</a> (at least one) and may have some <a>authors</a>.
            </p>
            <div data-include='src/conf/editors.html' data-oninclude='mungeConf'></div>
            <div data-include='src/conf/authors.html' data-oninclude='mungeConf'></div>
            <p>
                Editors are the people in charge of the document. Authors are people who produced substantial
                contributions, but did not manage the document per se. Most of the time authors are not specified, but
                that practice varies between groups (it was more common in XGs for instance, or sometimes in order to
                get academic credit the whole group is mentioned). Here is an example of specifying two editors and one
                author (with the surrounding document clipped for readability):
            </p>
                <pre class='example highlight'>
          var respecConfig = {
              // ...

            <p>
                Most groups maintain some form of version control system which is exposed over the web so that people
                can keep track of what edits are being made to a specification in between official releases. It is often
                useful to point to such documents, including from released specifications, so that people wishing to
                report issues can make sure that they aren't already fixed, and in general get the very latest version.
                In fact, EDs are often considered to be the most useful reference to have to a group's work. Two options
                control this.

            <p>
                A specification does not always travel alone. In some cases, there can be an accompanying <a>errata</a>
                document, which you can specify by providing a URL for it ( <a
                    href='examples/boilerplate.html?specStatus=REC;errata=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/erratum'>example</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise, some groups occasionally find it desirable to produce alternative formats in which people may
                read the specification. For instance, to access it on an ebook reader you may produce an ePub
                alternative, or if your specification is intended to be read by printing devices you might use PDF. The
                <a>alternateFormats</a> option is set to an array of objects, each of which has two required fields:
                <code>uri</code>, for the link to the alternate document, and <code>label</code>, for a human readable
                string that matches it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your specification has a test suite (it does, right?), then you can point to it using
                <a>testSuiteURI</a>. And when your tests have successfully passed in enough implementations, you will
                want to document that in an implementation report which you can link to using
                <a>implementationReportURI</a>.

                By default, W3C specifications all get the regular W3C copyright notice and archaic document license,
                except for unofficial documents which are under CC-BY. In some cases however, you will want to modify
                that.
            </p>
            <p>
                For all document types other than "unofficial", you can use <a>additionalCopyrightHolders</a> to
                indicate that the copyright is shared not just amongst the W3C's hosts but also with other organisations
                (typically this is used for documents developed jointly with another SDO such as the IETF). For
                unofficial documents, this simply replaces the default CC-BY license.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish the copyright date to span several years rather than just the year matching
                <a>publishDate</a> (e.g. 2009-2013) then you can use <a>copyrightStart</a>.

                At times, the patent situation of a specification may warrant being documented beyond the usual

                SotD section (right after the patent policy paragraph).

            <h2>Note &amp; Recommendation Tracks</h2>

            <p>
                If you are working on a new version of an existing Recommendation, then it is required that your
                document point to that previous version. This is done using the <a>prevRecShortname</a> and <a>prevRecURI</a>
                options, which respectively provide the <a>shortName</a> for the existing Recommendation (e.g. "SVG", as
                opposed to "SVG2") and its URI. You can <a
                    href='examples/boilerplate.html?prevRecShortname=dahuts-v0;prevRecURI=http://w3.org/TR/dahuts-v0/'>look
                at an example</a>. If <a>prevRecURI</a> is not specified but <a>prevRecShortname</a> is, the latter will
                be used to generate the former by prefixing "http://www.w3.org/TR/" to it. Note however that while in
                the overwhelming majority of cases this works, it is not recommended to use this approach since if the
                Recommendation is later Rescinded, the link will be stale. Instead, use the dated link to the
                Recommendation.

                The process for the publication of Notes has been a source of confusion. When producing multiple drafts
                of a Note in succession, some groups have traditionally simply published them all as Notes one after the
                other, indicating in the abstract or SotD if they intend to work further on this document or if it is
                final. Since Notes are not normative and entail no IP concerns, they don't need an elaborate process and
                this process was perhaps not entirely bad. However, that's not how Notes are commonly handled nowadays.
            </p>
            <p>
                The currently recommended process for Notes is closer to that which is used for Recommendation Track
                documents, typically: FPWD -> WD (<var>n</var> times) -> LC -> Note. Given that any group may decide at
                any time to release a Rec-Track document as a Note instead (often because it has been abandoned) this is
                Process-correct but it does involve jumping through hoops (notably for IP) that likely should not be
                needed. It has been explained to me several times why this switch took place, but I can never recall the
                justification. At any rate, if you are confused with the Note track process but wish to stick to it, you
                can do so by setting <a>noRecTrack</a> to <code>true</code>.

        <h2>Structure</h2>

        <p>
            This chapter covers all the aspects of a ReSpec document's structure that were not covered as part of the
            very basics. As usual, let's start with an example. It is fairly long as it needs a decent amount of content
            in order to exemplify some features, but it should nevertheless be easy to understand.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" data-include='examples/structure.html' data-include-format='text'></pre>
        <p>
            You can see <a href='examples/structure.html'>this example in action</a>.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>Sections</h2>

            <p>
                Sections, subsections, appendices, and whatever other structural items are marked up in ReSpec using
                <code>&lt;section></code> elements. If you're concerned about using an HTML5 construct that won't
                degrade well to older browsers, don't worry: ReSpec also adds the HTML5 shim/shiv and styling that makes
                them work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first child element of a section is expected to be one of the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>
                elements. Any old one will do, since whichever one you pick will be renamed to use the level that
                matches the depth at which your section is nested. As you can see, the example uses only <code>h2</code>
                elements, but that is not what appears in the output. Using <code>h2</code> everywhere is sort of a
                tacit convention, but if you prefer <code>h5</code> that'll work just the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sections will be automatically numbered. If you wish a section to have a specific ID, then simply use an
                <code>id</code> attribute on it. If you don't, ReSpec will generate one for you based on the section
                title, and will ensure that it is unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                ReSpec sections understand some specific classes. First is the <code><a>introductory</a></code> class.
                It is used (rarely) for preliminary content that sits at the beginning of the document and which is not
                expected to be linked to from the table of contents. The abstract, SotD, and ToC sections automatically
                fall into this category (you need not worry about flagging them as such); the example above adds an
                “Overview” section exemplifying the behaviour. If you <em>do</em> wish all the introductory sections to
                be present in the ToC, see <a>tocIntroductory</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then is the <code><a>informative</a></code> class. It is used for regular sections or appendices that
                are not meant to contain normative material. It will automatically preface its content with the
                well-know “This section is non-normative” paragraph. The “Introduction” section in the example shows how
                it works.
            </p>
            <p>
                And finally is the <code><a>appendix</a></code> class. It marks a section as being an appendix, as can
                be seen appearing at the end of the example. One important thing to know about appendix sections is that
                all the sections that follow an appendix will also be marked as appendices.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to link to a section and have its number and title automatically appear as part of the link,
                then you can use an empty anchor pointing to that ID, as in <code>&lt;a href='#foo'>&lt;/a></code>. The
                “Overview” section contains an example of that.
            </p>
            <p>
                A table of contents is generated automatically and placed right after the SotD. If you have a deeply
                nested document structure and find that the ToC is either too long or too deep, you can use the <a>maxTocLevel</a>
                option to limit how deep it goes. In the example used above, there is no limit and indeed one section is
                numbered 4.1.1.1.1.1 — rather deep. Setting <a>maxTocLevel</a> to other values will yield <a
                    href='examples/structure.html?maxTocLevel=1'>different results</a> (<a
                    href='examples/structure.html?maxTocLevel=2'>other example with maxTocLevel=2</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                The more observant readers will have noted that ReSpec also inserts some strange-looking comments in the
                generated source, that look like <code>&lt;!-- OddPage --></code>. These are present so that <code>html2ps</code>
                knows how to paginate correctly. Perhaps not useful to most but helpful to those who rely on it for
                printing, and harmless.
            </p>
            <p>
                If for whatever reason you wish to have no table of contents, simply set <code><a>noTOC</a></code> to
                <code>true</code>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Figures</h2>

            <p>
                Figures are also supported natively, using the <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> elements,
                and exhibit some features similar to sections. They are automatically granted an ID, and the caption is
                remembered for use elsewhere, as described below.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Table of Figures is not generated by default, but making it happen is straightforward: all you need
                to do is add a section with ID <code>tof</code> anywhere in the document. ReSpec will do its best to
                guess if it should be an appendix, introductory, or just a regular section. Because the list has no
                depth, there is no equivalent to <a>maxTocLevel</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And finally, automatic linking to figures works just as it does for sections, with <code>&lt;a
                href='#foo-figures'>&lt;/a></code>. All of the above is demonstrated in the example.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Examples &amp; Syntax Highlighting</h2>

            <p>
                Any <code>pre</code> or <code>div</code> element that has the <code>example</code> class on it will get
                the additional example header and style. Additionally, if a <code>highlight</code> class is added to the
                same, the content will get syntax highlighted. The syntax highlighter does not need to be instructed
                about which language it is highlighting and will try to do a decent job of guessing.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use <code>highlight</code> on <code>code</code> elements. If the highlighting is
                insufficient for your needs, or in the wrong colours, you can override the applicable styles in your own
                style sheet.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Inclusions &amp; Transformations</h2>

            <p>
                At times you need to include an external resource directly into your document. This may be because your
                specifications have additional boilerplate, or (like it's done in this very guide) because you want
                examples to be both inlined and accessed directly without having to make sure that they are always in
                sync.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inclusion of external content in ReSpec is done using the <code><a>data-include</a></code> attribute. It
                is expected to point to a resource, using its relative path from the including document. The content
                will get included as a child of the element on which the inclusion is performed (unless <a>data-include-replace</a>
                is used, in which case it replaces the element), replacing its existing content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The include filter runs recursively so that included content that contains
                <code><a>data-include</a></code> attributes will work (just be sure not to build a circular loop in
                there, ReSpec won't detect it if only because it doesn't mind if you're shooting yourself in the foot).
            </p>
            <p>
                By default the inclusion is asynchronous, which means that the included content may or may not be
                further processed by ReSpec after it gets added to the DOM (the result won't be deterministic and so is
                only useful if the content is <em>not</em> meant to be further processed). If you wish to ensure that
                ReSpec processing is applied to the content, use <code><a>data-include-sync</a></code>. Be warned that
                there is a steep performance penalty in doing so, since all ReSpec processing will effectively pause
                until the content has been fully fetched and inserted.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the processing pipeline, inclusion happens right after everything to do with the document's headers,
                style, and transformations have happened, which means that all the processing to do with structure,
                inlines, WebIDL, and everything else is applied to the included content as if it had always been part of
                the source.
            </p>
            <p>
                At times however one does not wish included content to be processed as if it were intended to be ReSpec
                content. For instance, content containing HTML may be an example that should not be processed (the
                examples in this document are included that way). In such cases, you can specify <code><a>data-include-format</a>='text'</code>.
                This will include the content as if it were text, and therefore only process it as much as text is
                expected to be. The only recognised value is <code>text</code>, nominally you can always set it to
                <code>html</code> but that's the default value.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is an important caveat to take into account with the <code>data-include</code> functionality.
                ReSpec is designed so as to make life easier on editors. Because of that, people who do not wish to run
                a local web server and simply want to edit and refresh the specification they're working on from their
                local drives, using a <code>file:</code> URI in the browser, are completely supported in doing so (this
                involves some trickery behind the scenes since it would normally make it impossible to load some of the
                content that ReSpec uses — but that's not something you should ever have to know). When using <code>data-include</code>
                however, this is no longer possible. You either have to serve your ReSpec content from a web server or
                the included content will get blocked by the same-origin policy (which applies to all things
                <code>file:</code>). There is, unfortunately, no easy way to work around this. Be sure to note however
                that if you're <em>not</em> using <code>data-include</code>, you <em>never</em> have to worry about
                this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, at times, you may wish to perform a quick and dirty transformation of some of your content. If
                the transformation is one that is commonly used and could be of general usefulness outside your own
                specification, then the proper way of handling it is to add the functionality to ReSpec itself. However,
                in a pinch, this approach will work as well. The way in which it is done is that you include a globally
                available Javascript function that takes the ReSpec <code>utils</code> object as its first parameter and
                a string of the content to be transformed as its second; then returns the processed value. Then where
                you wish the transformation to apply, you place a <code><a>data-transform</a></code> attribute — it will
                then process the entire content. The value of <code><a>data-transform</a></code> is a white space
                separated list of JavaScript function names. They are applied left to right, as if they were a pipeline.
                Again, I would like to stress that, in general, that is not the recommended approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to transform content brought in with <code><a>data-include</a></code> irrespective of
                whether it is loaded synchronously or not, use <code><a>data-oninclude</a></code>. It behaves exactly
                like <code><a>data-transform</a></code> except that the function gets a third parameter indicating the
                relative URL from which the content was loaded
            </p>

        <h2>Common Inline Processing</h2>

        <p>
            Many repetitive tasks happen at the level of inline text, and ReSpec helps with those as well. This chapter
            covers references, along with the <a href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>SpecRef database</a>, the
            handling of abbreviations and acronyms, automatic RFC 2119 keyword detection, <code>dfn</code> definitions,
            and easier in-document linking.
        </p>

        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>RFC 2119</h2>

            <p>
                A very common construct in specifications is to use keywords defined in RFC 2119 which indicate
                precisely, using commonly agreed conventions, what requirements are placed on an implementation with
                what degree of strength (e.g. MUST, SHOULD NOT). All you need to do as an author is to include an
                all-caps MUST in your source and it will automatically get marked up as such (with the accompanying
                style applied to it afterwards).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Abbreviations &amp; Acronyms</h2>

            <p>
                HTML supports functionality to mark abbreviations and acronyms (using <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code>
                respectively), using the <code>title</code> attribute to provide the expanded version. This is something
                that's nice to do once, but tedious to repeat every time that a given term is used. What ReSpec does is
                that it allows you to do it just once, and it will detect all other uses of the same in the text and
                will automatically mark them up in the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that ReSpec could not possibly care less about whether you think that <code>acronym</code> is a
                valid element or not; if you use it, it will process it.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Definitions and Linking</h2>

            <p>
                HTML also supports the notion that you can give a term's definition using the <code>dfn</code> element.
                While that is nice, it is even better to link back to the definition whenever a term is used, which in
                turn is tedious. While ReSpec could go through the entire text and link every occurrence of a defined
                term back to its definition, that would be a problematic approach since it would risk linking the same
                term used with a different meaning. What it does instead is that it allows you to use an
                <code>href</code>-less <code>a</code> element around a term when you use it, and it will manage the link
                on its own (e.g. <code>&lt;a>term&lt;/a></code>).
            </p>
            <p>
                On occasion that won't be enough since you may be using the term in plural or conjugated, or in some
                other variant that does not exactly match the <code>dfn</code>. If so, then you can use the
                <code>title</code> attribute on the <code>a</code> element in order to indicate the exact term that you
                wish to have a link to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note that the <code>href</code>-less <code>a</code> element is not limited to linking to
                definitions but also knows how to link to other items such as WebIDL interfaces.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>References</h2>

            <p>
                Specifications typically need to have references to other specifications on which they build to define
                their own technology. Managing references is a pain, as is linking to them every time that they are
                mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                ReSpec takes the pain out of this with multiple features that are used together. First, when you need to
                refer to a given specification in the body of the text, simply do so using
                <code>[[<span>FOO</span>]]</code> for informative references (those that are just intended to clarify
                the matter at hand) and <code>[[!
                <spac>FOO</spac>
                ]]</code> for normative ones (those which are required for the implementation of the specification at
                hand). ReSpec will replace those with the link the reference and the appropriate markup around it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, using all the collected references from the document, ReSpec will generate a “References” section
                with subsections for normative and informative references (when they appear). Inside the latter, it will
                place the relevant bibliographical data for those references, using the conventional markup.
            </p>
            <p>
                References are loaded from a shared database that is maintained by a group of volunteers. If you need a
                reference that is not in the database, then the right thing to do is to submit it for inclusion so that
                others can benefit from it too. However, if that is not possible then you can make use of the <a>localBiblio</a>

            <p>
                If you wish the “References” section to be prefaced with some text, you can set the <a>refNote</a>
                option to the content you wish to use, as in <a
                    href='examples/inlines.html?refNote=Some%20text%20inserted%20here'>this example</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only things you therefore need to know for references are the reference names of the specifications
                you wish to refer to (as well as to how to add your own to the database). The names are usually rather
                logical, and most of the time can be guessed. In other cases, you can go look for them in the central
                bibliographical database that is maintained at <a href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>SpecRef
                database</a>.

            <h2>Best Practice Documents</h2>

            <p>
                Best practices may be shown, numbered, and formatted using a <code>div</code> with class <code><a>practice</a></code>
                containing a <code>p > span.<a>practicelab</a></code> with the practice's title and a <code>p.<a>practicedesc</a></code>
                with description of the practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                This feature is rarely used, and likely needs to be updated. If you wish to use it in anger, please
                contact me and we can improve support for it.
            </p>
                <pre class='example'>
&lt;div class="practice"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span id="some-practice" class="practicelab"&gt;Title of the practice&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="practicedesc"&gt;
    More detailed description of the practice.          
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
            <p>
                If a <code>section</code> element with <code>id</code> "<code>bp-summary</code>" is present, then a
                summary list of best practices will be placed in it, linked to the best practices that have an id on the
                <code>span</code> element.

        <h2>Creating a Static Snapshot</h2>

        <p>
            Of course the downside of the approach taken by ReSpec is that the specification as it is expected to be,
            with all its bells and whistles, exists only in your browser's memory as a DOM. Publishing directly with the
            script would not work as the source would not pass PubRules and would work poorly with search engines that
            do not process JS (also people generally frown upon reference documents that do not work without
            JavaScript). does not work for all browsers (and there are still quite a few people using Internet Explorer
            out there) and would not show all the content for search indexing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution that is used here is that you hit the <code>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S</code> key combination. Unless you
            know what you are doing, pick "Save as HTML (Source)". This will produce a dump of the generated source,
            which you can paste into the document you want to be your specification snapshot. The process is a little
            bit tedious, but normally you should only need to do it very rarely. You can hit <code>Esc</code> to hide
            the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a copy of the ReSpec repository handy, you may see that there is also a
            <code>respec2html.js</code> tool under <code>tools/</code>. Feel free to try using it instead of the above
            process, but please note that it is not used much currently and may behave in a somewhat experimental manner
            (experiences with it vary — but it's worth a shot if you're looking for a way to generate ReSpec output from
            the command line).
        </p>
        <p>
            ReSpec is also capable of producing a diff-marked version if you have a configuration setting of <a>previousDiffURI</a>
            set to a document to compare to (which defaults to <a>previousURI</a>). When you press that button, you will
            obtained a diffmarked version instead of a regular specification. By default, the diff tool is set to <code>http://www.aptest.com/standards/htmldiff/htmldiff.pl</code>,
            but you can override this by setting <a>diffTool</a>.

        <h2>WebIDL Support</h2>

        <p>
            This chapter is about WebIDL, the schema language for APIs. ReSpec has extensive WebIDL support, but
            naturally if you're not writing an API specification then you can definitely save yourself the trouble and
            skip this section.
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
            The WebIDL support in ReSpec is getting old compared current practices. In most cases it is still
            serviceable and it still beats managing the interlinking in a complex API by hand. That said, it is slated
            for an upgrade that will bring it more in line with the way APIs are defined today. Stay tuned.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issues with editing WebIDL by hand are as follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                while evolving an API, it is easy to get the WebIDL proper and the accompanying prose out of sync;
            </li>
            <li>
                proper linking from WebIDL to content and back is often too tedious to be done in full;
            </li>
            <li>
                syntax highlighting is generally given up on, at a cost in readability.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            ReSpec does its best to provide all three of the above at a minimal cost. It does that by destructuring the
            WebIDL syntax so as to make it easy to keep definition and documentation together.
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach is simple. An interface is defined using a <code>dl</code> element, with a <code>class</code>
            of "<code>idl</code>" and a <code>title</code> attribute that is the defining line for the interface, for
            instance <code>[Constructor] interface Dahut : Mammal, Cryptoid</code> or <code>exception Boom</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside the <code>dl</code>, each <code>dt</code>/<code>dd</code> pair defines an interface member
            (attribute, constant, operation). The content of the <code>dt</code> element is the line that defines the
            member (e.g. <code>readonly attribute DOMString chirality</code> or <code>void yell ([AllowAny] unsigned
            long volume, [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] DOMString sentence)</code>); and the <code>dd</code> element contains
            the description in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            This format has the advantage of keeping information well-grouped together, using HTML markup for the most
            part (so that even WYSIWYG editors can be used), while being simple to parse and sufficiently expressive for
            most needs (especially as more features are added).
        </p>
        <p>
            The output that is generated replaces the <code>dl</code> with a syntax-highlighted and linked WebIDL
            segment with all the members for the given interface in the order in which they were defined; followed by
            subsections listing attributes, constants, and methods in alphabetical order.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example will probably speak more clearly. Here is an interface that inherits from another before defining
            some constants, attributes, and operations.
        </p>
            <pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;dl title='[Constructor] interface Dahut : Mammal' class='idl'>
  &lt;dt>const unsigned short LEVROGYROUS = 0&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Turning left.
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>const unsigned short DEXTROGYROUS = 1&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Turning right.
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>readonly attribute DOMString chirality&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>attribute unsigned long age&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
     Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>Dahut turnAround (float angle, boolean fall)&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>unsigned long trip ()&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>void yell ([AllowAny] unsigned long volume,
                    [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] DOMString sentence)&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit (...)
  &lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl></pre>
        <p>
            Most WebIDL constructs are supported. The best way to learn is likely to look at the <a
                href='examples/webidl.html'>WebIDL examples document</a> and to compare the source with the generated
            output.
        </p>
        <p>
            At times you may wish to have multiple WebIDL constructs shown in a single section instead of spread across
            several. For that, you can use the <code><a>data-merge</a></code> attribute. It contains a white space
            separated list of WebIDL object names to be merged with the interface.
